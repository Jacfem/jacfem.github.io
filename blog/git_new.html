					<h1>Version Control, Git and GitHub</h1>

			<h3>What are the benefits of version control?</h3>
				<p>
				Version control is a type of system that helps you & your team confidently manage and work on projects. It stores various versions of your files anytime you ‘commit’ changes, which functions like save points in a video game. If you mess something up, you can go back to that save point (in Version Control, your last commit!), and try a new strategy from there.
This safety net is really important in a real-world work setting. If any bugs arise from new code or changes being added, you can revert back to an older version prior to the bug, and then work on debugging the piece of code to be added at a later time. A team might be working on adding a new feature to a website, think it's good to go, make it live online, and then find out it crashed the website! With version control systems, they can revert back to a state of their website that did NOT contain the new feature to get it back up & functioning. From there, the team can work on figuring out what went wrong in the code, without disrupting the main project, in this case, their website.
Version control allows various branches of code to be worked on and then merged, so two (or more) people can be working on the same file at the same time, but making different changes that will not interfere with another. I like to think of Microsoft Word versus a Google Document on Google Drive. If you’re working on Google Drive, any the changes made will be updated in real time, by any number of people, which risks a number of over-writes & loss of material. It also gives anyone with ‘edit’ access free reign, so no one needs to decide that a change should in fact be made. With Microsoft Word on the other hand, If you send 2 people the same document, they can make their own changes & save their own file, e-mail them back to you, and you can then approve their changes to be merged into your original document. This latter method is more akin to GitHub, as any new versions pushed up to GitHub need to be approved to be merged by the project owner. This provides some security & integrity for the owner of the project. It will also help keep track of the project & its updates, because any change that is made & committed (and merged!) will have a time stamp on it as well as description of what was changed. Unlike Microsoft Word however, anytime you save or 'commit' your work, a new version is created (so commits are more like Word's 'Save As' function rather than just 'Save'). All of these benefits are key for teams to securely work on projects with many moving parts, and at different phases of its production & features.

  		<h3>How does git help you keep track of changes?</h3>
				<p>
			Keeping track of changes in projects is vital to ensure everything is up to date, and to have a security net in case something goes wrong. If you’re working in your command line on making & committing some changes to any code, by using the command ‘git status,’ you’ll receive one of 3 messages: Changes not staged for commit, Changes to be committed, and Nothing to commit, everything is up to date. This is your version control system's (in this case, Git!) way of tracking changes. This command helps manage the workflow of making changes by explicitly telling you which stage each of your files are in. By tracking these changes, we are able to commit them (which again, gives you that save point), and then push them up to GitHub, which will also track any changes that have been added to projects with timestamps & titles for each change.
				</p>

  		<h3>Why use GitHub to store your code?</h3>
				<p>
				GitHub is a great place to store your code so that you & your team can ensure you’re all working on the most up to date versions of your project. A great feature on GitHub is forking, which lets you can create a new project from one that already exists on GitHub. If you like someone’s work and want to either add value to it, or create a new project of your own, you can basically grab their code GitHub & save it to your own computer to work on.
If you really like what you did with this project, and want to show it to the person who created the original version, you can make a ‘pull request.’ This functions sort of like a hand-raise, and then you addressing the project owner as follows- ‘Hey, loved your project – I made some updates to it, can you read them over & let me know if you think you want to use them too?’ It provides a platform for developers to improve their work together, and learn from each other.
A somewhat rough but physical example of this could be: A photographer is editing his newest picture, and puts it online. You see it & love the way it looks, but think it should contain more shadow effect, so you take a copy of it into your Editing System, add shadows, and then send it back to the Photographer, who might actually like the way the photo looks now more than before!
Storing your code on GitHub is not only functional & a good way to back up your projects, but allows a community of passionate people to workshop projects, and network.
