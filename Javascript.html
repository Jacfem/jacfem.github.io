					<h1>JavaScript Constructor Functions</h1>
		</div>

    <div class="post">
        <h3>In the Context of Ruby</h3>
        <p>Building upon last week’s post regarding Classes in Ruby, I’d like to introduce JavaScript Constructor methods & compare the two.</p>
        <p>Recall that in Ruby, Classes function as blueprints for new objects that we would like to have the same behavior & variables. This gives us the ability to create multiple objects spawning from one class, with the same variables, but changing variable values, also known as instance variables.</p>
        <p>Making a Class in Ruby looks like this:</p>
      </div>

        <h4 class ="img-800"><img class="large" img src="imgs/ruby_classes_compare.png"></h4>
        <h4 class ="img-800"><img src="imgs/ruby_classes_compare_output.png"></h4>

      <div class="post">
        <p>JavaScript allows similar functionality through Constructor Functions. A constructor function can be thought of as a function that allows us to create something, which is why it’s similar to Classes in Ruby. The syntax to create a constructor method & object is below:</p>
      </div>

        <h4 class ="img-800"><img src="imgs/js_constructor_compare.png"></h4>
        <h4 class ="img-800"><img src="imgs/js_constructor_compare_output.png"></h4>

      <div class="post">
        <p>While in Ruby, we have instance variable values, in JavaScript, we have property values. In our first example, we used a name instance variable to store any new object’s name, which in our case, was Jackie.</p>
        <p>In JavaScript, what was known as our instance variable, is now referred to as a name ‘property’ with the value as ‘Jackie.’</p>
        <p>You probably can tell from the syntax that JavaScript tends to have more punctuation than Ruby, but I actually enjoy this constructor method a bit more than creating Classes. The functionality that ‘this.property’ provides feels more succinct than instance variables, and looks cleaner without the @ symbol. However, looking at our output, we’ve accomplished the same goal of creating a new object with certain variable/property values!</p>
