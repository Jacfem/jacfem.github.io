        <h1>What is Ruby on Rails?</h1>
  </div>

      <div class="post">
        <p>So I’ve been learning & reflecting on Ruby for about a month now, and I feel it’s time to tackle the concept I keep hearing called ‘Ruby on Rails.’</p>
        <p>Is it a juiced up version of Ruby? Is it portable Ruby? Not <i>exactly</i>…</p>
        <p>Ruby on Rails, referred to as ‘Rails,’ is an open-source software library that extends the Ruby programming language. It’s important to note that Rails is not a programming language, but it actually was written in the Ruby language. It’s basically an added ‘framework’ for building websites. What’s a framework though?</p>
        <h2>Frameworks</h2>
        <p>Just like the non-technical idea of a framework, a web application framework gives users a basic structure that supports the creation of something. For example, to build a house, you want the framework of a Blueprint. For Ruby, Rails provides the framework for building websites.</p>
        <p>The goal of Rails is to make your life easier as you’re creating applications! Quite simply, it makes assumptions that let you write less code but actually create more.</p>
        <p>Web frameworks like Ruby use what’s called a model-view-controller architecture (MVC) to organize application programming. An MVC is a solution for designing web applications. It basically separates what the user sees on the front end from what’s happening on the backend.</p>
        <h2>MVC</h2>
        <p>Models: Ruby classes that handle the logic of your application. Talk to databases.</p>
        <p>Views: Templates that render data from the models & present views to the user.</p>
        <p>Controller: Sits between the two and handles your requests/changes.</p>
        <p>These three elements interact with each other back and forth in order to make your life easier!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="post">
        <p>The takeaway from this reflection is that Rails provides a back-end framework to make web applications much more quickly than you normally would without it!</p>
