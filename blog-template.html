<!--How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
Wireframing as a pair was fairly fast because we decided to each go with our own design, which were similar but simple.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Because this was such a bare-bones website, wireframing did not feel extremely necessary for this process. However, I do feel that there will be great benefits to planning this out visually beforehand, and iterating prior to development. I'm a big planner so I'd like to see how this process works on larger projects.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided a simple wireframe is best right now, which leaves room for syle changes and additions.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I didn't learn any new semantic elements but I did find a better wireframing technology that I'll be using from now on (Mockups).
