						<a href="http://www.mentorship-app.com">Mentorship: A Rails App to connect Mentors with Mentees</a></h2>
						<br>
						<p>As someone who used to work in Recruiting, and someone currently undergoing a careeer transition to Web Development, finding a mentor is critical. I felt there was a need for a platform that more seamlessly allows users to find and connect with potential mentors and those seeking mentorship, to open the door for meaningful and mutually rewarding professional relationships. I pitched this idea to my Dev Bootcamp Cohort, and it was voted as one of five final projects. I served as Team Lead in a group of 4, built in just 1 week. We used LinkedIn's API, a Rails backend with Postgres, and Foundation/CSS for the front-end.<br><br>
