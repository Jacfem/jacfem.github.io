What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?
I learned a lot about the differences & interactions with padding, borders and margins. I learned that the three of them work together to create a smooth layout, but you don't need to visually see all of them. You actually can't see a margin, it's moreso felt by how much margin you create in between elements. You can see borders, but you don't have to keep them visible on your page. Padding can help increase readability inside your page's sections.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?
Positioning is still a delicate thing for me. Display properties can help you identify how you'd like certain elements to sit on a page (On it's own level or on level with other elements?). A static position is what's by default set for elements. Switching to absolute will position your element in relation to the first parent element that is NOT static. A relative element will move relative to where it would have been if static. A fixed element cements itself to a browser window, so scrolling through a page will not move the element. All of these will still be affected by sizing and positioning properties in terms of moving something left, right, up or down.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?
The easiest aspect was how to insert images, create borders, color text, and position headers. The hardest was to position my footer for various pages that have different amounts of content above the footer. I tried using the fixed position, but I don't want the button to be visible at all times. I ended up positioning it individually for my home page, blog, and blog index, but I'd like to find a way that will position it more responsively.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned how to keep track of classes/ids, create a curved border (border-radius property), how to add a new font-set in, and how to re-size images to be the same size by using max-width & max-height for my social media buttons. I stopped because of time, but still had some more positioning to do!
